# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage to assist me with notes in the bootcamp class. I will come back to this page if I need to go over notes during projects or the class itself.
I learned many key features in the building of a webpage, such as styling with CSS, writing the base info with HTML, and the key background components with Javascript.
